Subject: Termination of Services under MSA

Dear Counsel,

We refer to the Master Services Agreement dated 10 March 2023 between Acme
Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (“Acme”) and Brightwave Solutions LLP (“Brightwave”).

Due to ongoing performance issues and repeated delays in delivery, we are considering
termination of the Agreement for cause with effect from 1 December 2025.

Please confirm:
1. Whether we are contractually entitled to terminate for cause on the basis of repeated delays in delivery;
2. The minimum notice period required.

We would appreciate your advice by 18 November 2025.

Regards,
Priya Sharma
Legal Manager, Acme Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
